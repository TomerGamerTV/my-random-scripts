## 📖 Purpose

This repository is a personal collection of various scripts and utilities I've developed to automate tasks, solve specific problems, or experiment with different technologies. Most of these scripts are:

- 🔧 Configured for my personal environment/needs
- 🧪 Created through experimentation/learning
- ⚡ Built to solve very specific use cases
- 🗃️ Organized in a way that makes sense to me

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is not a maintained software project!** While you're welcome to explore and use anything you find here, please understand:

- 🚨 These scripts come with **no warranty** or support
- 🔍 You may need to modify configurations/variables to make them work in your environment
- 🐛 There might be unresolved edge cases or bugs I never encountered
- 💥 Some scripts might make breaking changes to your system if not properly adapted
- 🛑 I am **not responsible** for any issues or damages caused by using these scripts

**Always:**  

1. 📖 Carefully read through any script before execution  
2. 🧪 Test in a safe environment first  
3. 🔄 Modify configurations to match your needs

## 🚀 Usage Guide (For Visitors)

If you want to try using any of these scripts:

1. **Inspect the code** thoroughly
2. **Adjust** all hardcoded values/paths in the scripts
3. **Check dependencies** (Python packages, CLI tools, etc.)
4. **Test cautiously** with non-critical data
5. **Modify** as needed for your use case

Most scripts will require modifications to:
